Golden Gate Bridge Problem:

Step 1:
Find sizes of everything needed.
Length of Golden Gate Bridge is: 2737 Meters
Width of Golden Gate Bridge: 27 Meters
Diameter of penny: 19.05 Milimeters
Convert both to same units:
	Bridge: 2737000 mm long, 27000 mm wide
	Penny: 19.05 mm long

Because pennies are circles, we won't be able to fully fill the bridge; there will be some empty space.

Step 2:
We will have 2 alternating rows
()()()()()()()  -- 1417 pennies
 ()()()()()()   -- 1415 pennies
This will repeat for the entire length of the bridge.

Step 3:
Because of the way they are layed out with a slight overlap, we cannot just divide the length of the bridge by the length of a single penny to find the number of total rows.

The length of the two rows is 33 mm.

Step 4:
I now divide the total length of the bridge by the length of the two rows.
2737000mm/33mm = 82 939.3939
Because we need whole numbers, we need to round down to 82,939 sets of rows

Step 5:
Finally, we multiply this by the number of pennies in the set (1417 + 1415)
and get 82939 * (1417+1415) = 234 883 248 Total Pennies
