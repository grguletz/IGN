	For years, I have been a major fan of IGN. I read your reviews and news, and considered myself a fan. Now that I am in college and growing up, I am ready to move on from being a fan to actually contributing to the team. 
	I am a Computer Science student at UC Santa Barbara and for the past year, have been dedicated to learning as much as possible about programming and computers. These have become true passions for me and when working, I am motivated and willing to learn whatever I need to make my skills improve.
	Unfortunately, I haven't been able to learn much about web development so far and because of the program I am currently in, might not be able to be taught this in school for a few more years. I need IGN to help me get some real-world experience. Up until this point, all of the programming work I have done has been n a classroom. I would love to be able to experience what real-world work is like to make sure that this is the right field for me. 
	IGN need me because I am a hard-working, motivated worker. Im willing to fully commit myself to the job and learn as much as possible in those first three weeks. I already have some background coding experience so I will be able to pick up the new information pretty quickly. I would love to persue a career at IGN after I graduate and going to Code Foo would be an amazing opportunity for me to show IGN what I can do.
